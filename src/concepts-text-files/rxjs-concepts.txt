***********************************************
What is RxJS and Why RxJS in Angular?

      => RxJS stands for Reactive Extension for Javascript.

      => A way to handle asynchronous operations, events and data streams.

      => Heavily used in Angular's core features (like httpClient, FromControls.valueChanges, and routing) all uses RxJS under the hood.


**********************************************
Why RxJS in Angular?

     => Working with HTTP: All httpClient methods return Observables

     => From input tracking: valueChanges returns an Observables.

     => Route parameters: ActivatedRoute.paraMap is an Observables.

     => State management: RxJS is the foundation of library like NgRx.

     => Building Responsive UI: You can react to user inputs, data changes, and server responses easily using RxJS.



*********************************************
What is Observable?

      => Observable is something which continuously emits the data over the time.

      => They can complete, error out, or Keep streaming the data.

      => We need to subscribe to start receiving the values.

      => All subscribed Observable must needs to be Unsubscribed other memmory leake will happen.



*******************************************
Creating and Subscribing to Observable

      => of, from, interval, timer, fromEvent, map, filter, pipe, tap etc




*******************************************
Subject and Behaviour Subject

      => Subject: It is a special type of Observable that allows value to be multicasted to the multiple observer.

      => While plain Observable is unicast(Each Subscribed Observer owns an independent execution of the Observable)

      => Behaviour Subject is a varient of the Subject which has notion of the current value.

      => It alwasy stored the latest value emitted to its consumer, and whenever a new Observer subscribes, it will 
         immediately recive the current value from the Behaviour Subject



***********************************************
Difference between Subject & Behaviour Subject

Subjects:
      => It is an Observable

      => Subject doesn't accept any initial value while creating a subject.

      => A component where we have subscribed the subject to recive the value/data, the component should load on 
         the UI then only will recive the latest data otherwise not.


Behaviour Subject:
      => It is also an Observable.

      => We can set the initial value of a Behaviour Subject

      => We can receive the latest data/value from the Behaviour subject event if the Component which has subscribe
         not loaded into the UI. 


*************************************************
FrokJoin Operator:
      => It is accepts an array of observables and returns a single Observable containing the values of all observables in an array.
      => The return data is the same sequence in which the Observable was passed.
      => This gets completed if all the observables gets complted.
      => If any observable(s) fails then it will go to the error block.
      => This is similar to Promise.all([]) in Javascript.


SwitchMap Operator:
      => It only executes the last observable.
      => For example, for a search query, while typing in the input, if we have written our logic to make an api call on entering the each character
         in search input. By using the SwitchMap we can discard all the initial characters until a full text has been entered into the input and only
         with the last enter value the api call will happen

MergeMap Operator:



ConcatMap Operator:
